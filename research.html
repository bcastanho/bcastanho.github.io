	<h2>Populism</h2>
  
  
   
	      <h3>Measuring Populist Discourse: The Global Populism Database</h3>
	      <h4> With Kirk A. Hawkins, Rosario Aguilar, Erin K. Jenne, Bojana Kocijan, and Cristobal Rovira Kaltwasser</h4>
	     
	      <p> This research note introduces the Global Populism Database, which measures the level of populism in the 
		      discourse of 215 chief executives (Presidents and Prime Ministers) from 66 countries across all 
		      continents. The dataset covers 279 government terms and includes more than 1,000 speeches, mostly
		      between 2000 and 2018. We describe the data and data generation process and move to give the broadest
		      description of the level of populism by leaders of government in the world. We give a few examples of 
		      how the dataset can be applied, for example to investigate the causes of populism (such as corruption 
		      and economic crisis) or to identify the policy consequences of populism (such as economic collapse, 
		      increased corruption, political participation, and the erosion of basic democratic freedoms). This
		      dataset promises to serve as a useful tool in determining the role of leader rhetoric in the spatial
		      and temporal variation of populism.

	      <h2> Social Media and Politics</h2>
	      
	      <h3>Birds in the Cage: Explaining Legislators' Use of Social Media in Europe</h3>
	      <h4>With Sven-Oliver Proksch</h4>
	      
	      <p>Social media presents politicians with more communication opportunities than ever before, but the question remains if
		      it relates to traditional forms of political communication. We propose that it can serve two possible goals: as a 
		      'substitute' channel for politicians and parties to get around constraints existing in other arenas; and as an 
		      'amplifier', used by actors to spread the same message diffused in other media. Using a novel  dataset containing 
		      all tweets posted by national MPs in the EU-28 over the course of 2018, and contemporary parliamentary speeches from
		      seven countries, we investigate a) whether and how we can use tweets' content to get individual-level estimates of
		      issue positions; b) use that to uncover intra-party dynamics and disagreement over policy; and c) how Twitter behavior,
		      such as rebellion against the party line, translates into real world practices in parliament. We find that sentiment 
		      about Europe on Twitter is a valid measure of MPs' Euroskepticism, and that those who dissent from their parties on 
		      Twitter get less speaking time in parliament. We also find that, while parties in various systems constrain speaking 
		      time for dissidents, those in party-centered systems also exert more control over their MPs' discourse in parliamentary 
		      speech, while MPs in candidate-centered systems appear more free to speak their minds.</p>
