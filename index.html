	<h1>Bruno Castanho Silva</h1>
	<p>I'm a PhD student in Comparative Politics at the Central European University in Budapest. My thesis is on the causes and consequences of populism in Europe and the Americas. Aside from that, I'm also interested on research methodology, more specifically causal inference, machine learning, and measurement. Non-research interests include football (the one you play using your foot and a ball) and movies.</p>
